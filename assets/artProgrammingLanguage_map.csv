21,28,29,Because they were boring?
22,23,24,Is that because you didn't pay any attention?
23,100,100,Programming videos are fun! We don't want your kind round here! No new language learnt
24,25,23,Are you sure?
25,26,27,We can tell if you lie! Did you pay attention?
26,100,100,Hmm suspicious maybe try a different video or different methods! Nice try!
27,100,100,You may not of learnt a new language or even tried! But honestly never loses good job!
28,100,100,They tend to be! Maybe have a shot another day at least you tried in the end. No new language learnt.
29,100,100,You need some more motivation! Have a think about your choices and come back! No new language learnt.
30,31,32,Good think you are ready to start building projects?
31,100,100,Nice! Great work today we are proud of you. You learnt a new language now keep it up!
32,33,34,Do you find it easy to learn programming?
33,100,100,Maybe this language isn't for you try another! Nice try we will give that one to you! New start to a language
34,100,100,That's okay not everyone does it will click soon! Nice attempt very honest. Good start to a new language.
35,37,38,Yessssss! Go do some worksheets and come back. Did you learn anything?
36,100,100,You know what no! We aren't doing this! no python no game! Go away and learn it right now. Good bye. No new language learnt.
37,39,40,Nice! Think you could build a calculator for us?
38,100,100,Go to some lectures; watch some video's and build some projects. Picked python that's worth a point.
39,100,100,Now you have built that calculator; use it to calculate the amount of points you deserve for learning python! a million!
40,100,100,Come back when you can build one! Great work today started learning python!
41,43,44,Order it right now. Are you too full up to learn a new programming language now?
42,100,100,Eh make yourself something healthy then; You ate healthy you don't need to learn a new programming language today. You ended without learning a new language but at least you ate well and have a working computer.
43,100,100,You ended without learning a new language. But you did get takeaway so that is worth it! Get Netflix up on that working computer.
44,45,46,You've made you decision you have to start to learn one now. How about SQL?
45,47,48,You are crazy right SQL it will be. Good luck! How about we learn SQL another day?
46,35,36,Amazing choice! who really wants to learn SQL? You are learning python now no choice. Have you learnt python before?
47,100,100,You ended without learning a new programming language but i think we can all respect the decision to not learn SQL. Nice work!
48,49,50,Stop digging your own grave. Ready to get started?
49,53,56,We are trying to save you here! come on! Get onto youtube and learn how to get started then. Do you know how to create a database now?
50,51,52,Music to our ears. Should you just head to bed?
51,100,100,You ended without learning a new language; but you have new found motivation for SQL. Why? Good night!
52,100,100,You ended without learning a new language; way too indecisive! Work something else without our help!
53,54,55,Great job try creating some tables and relations. Did you find that okay?
54,100,100,Great work SQL seems good for you. You started to learn a new language. Nice work!
55,100,100,Well SQL isn't for everyone (should be for no one). Nice effort today you made a beginning on learning a new language.
56,57,58,Then this is all your fault! why haven't you been going to your lectures? Are you going to go to your next SQL lecture?
57,59,60,Yeah you better! Do you think you'll try learning SQL again in the future?
58,100,100,You ended without learning a new language and without our respect! Go to your lectures then come back to us!
59,100,100,You know what! We will give that one to you! Started learning a language that's a good effort.
60,100,100,You aren't getting anyway with that! no language learnt.
61,100,100,Wow how boring fastest ending possible. No new language and you don't want new gadgets. Boring!
62,100,100,You ended without even attempting to learn a language; make sure to get some RGB on that new pc tho!
63,100,100,Make a choice next time! You ended without learning a new language; and frankly do you even like programming?
